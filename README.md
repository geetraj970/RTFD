Real-Time Face Detection

The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in face identification, driven by novel techniques in pattern recognition and computer vision. Notably, the integration of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) has greatly enhanced the accuracy of face identification methods. This progress is particularly pivotal in our interconnected society, where face recognition plays a crucial role in security systems, authentication processes, and crime detection. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, prevalent in today's world, serve diverse functions. Real-time face recognition within these systems involves comparing digital images or video frames of individuals with a stored database, meeting the escalating demand for personal identification in our global society. As CCTV technology, frequently employed in video surveillance systems, serves purposes like data security, asset protection, and traffic flow analytics, facial recognition emerges as a critical component for identifying individuals and detecting abnormal activities.
